# Installation

## Arch Linux (and CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Garuda)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadowww-dev/shadows-shell && cd shadows-shell
./install.sh
```
The installer runs `sudo pacman -S --needed` for packages found in the repos and uses `paru` or `yay` for the rest (for example `quickshell`, `awww`). Without an AUR helper it prints the list for you to install.

CachyOS works the same way: its repositories are used and `paru`, which CachyOS ships, installs the AUR packages. Manjaro holds packages back, so its Hyprland can be older than 0.55 (the config needs 0.55); the installer tells you at the end.

## Fedora (and Nobara)
```bash
sudo dnf install -y git
git clone https://github.com/shadowww-dev/shadows-shell && cd shadows-shell
./install.sh
```
Hyprland, its tools and Quickshell come from the `nett00n/hyprland` COPR, `awww` from `scottames/awww`. Packages Fedora does not have are listed and skipped. Fedora Atomic (Bazzite, Silverblue): the installer prints the `rpm-ostree` commands.

## Backups and undo
Every file the installer replaces is copied to `~/.config/darkshadows-shell-backup-<time>/`. Undo with `./install.sh --restore`.

## Other distros
The installer lists missing programs (Hyprland, Waybar, Quickshell `qs`, swaync, cava, rofi, jq, python3, awww, hyprlock). Install them with your package manager, then run `./install.sh`.
